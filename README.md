## The topic as well as the parameters you have used for search

```
    The topic of this research lab is the sentiment of guns in various American cities based on their stance on gun policies. The search was conducted 3 times on 3 different cities. The parameters used in this search are search_words, location, and date_since. For the search_words parameter I used "guns", the coordinates for Los Angeles, Houston, and Kansas City and 25.0 miles as the radius for the location parameter, and "2023-1-16" for the date_since parameter. Searching for the term "guns" makes sense to me because it is the weapon that is being debated. Los Angeles in California supposedly has high gun control, Houston in Texas and Kansas City in Missouri supposedly low gun control. The 25 mile radius is because it is generally the length to reach the outskirts of the city from the center. The date "2023-1-16" is because the twitter api limits users to fetch tweets from the last 7 days.

## Why do you want to make this comparison

```
    The reason for this comparison is because gun violence is a hotly debated political issue in the United States and the country continues to be affected by gun violence. Each state has different gun control policies and overall sentiments on the right to bear arms. It would be interesting to compare the sentiments of guns in cities with different levels of laxness in gun control. The level of laxness was selected based on [criminalattorneycincinnati.com](https://www.criminalattorneycincinnati.com/). There are politically left leaning and right leaning states where the cities are located that could be represented in this comparison.

## Compare the word clouds and discuss the difference or similarity among the word clouds

```
    The most biggest word for all 3 word clouds is Gun. Words like "people", "law", "know", "kill", "don", "ban", "go", "shoot", "more" are all medium to big size in all 3 word clouds. All 3 word clouds have small "right" but only Kansas City has "democrat". The word clouds for Los Angeles and Kansas City have a really large "Co". Los Angeles's cloud contains a large "mass" whereas the Kansas City cloud contains "school". The word clouds for Kansas City and Houston has "protect" (large in texas but small in Kansas City), large "kid". There are many other comparisons that could be made but I only listed a few.
```

## What might be the possible reasons for the patterns you observed

```
    The biggest word being gun is pretty self explanatory. Common words that are medium to large size between all 3 word clouds such as "people", "law", "know", "kill", "don", "ban", "go", "shoot", "more" might be from discussions about the gun control laws. I can see the word "don" being an error from the word "don't" in which case could be people said guns don't kill people and that people kill people. The term "Right" found in all clouds might be due to users blaming the right political spectrum for the gun violence and the "Democrat" could be the right blaming the left for infringing on their gun owning rights. The "Co" in the LA and Kansas City word clouds could possibly be an error in the word cloud importing feature. The "mass" in LA and the "school" in Kansas City could be showing the type of shootings that are taking place in the area recently. The "protect" in Kansas City and Houston could be people explaining how guns are used for self defense and the "kid" could be describing the victims or perpetrators of shootings. Additionally, "kid" could be a way that people on twitter talk about young people.
```

## How your research could be improved in the future

```
    A way that my research could be improved in the future is by using a larger dataset of tweets if possible. The twitter api limited my searches to within the last 7 days, if a certain day could be accessed I would select a date that a major mass shooting occurred to get stronger stances on the topic. The research could also account for biases, perhaps people that are pro gun control use twitter more than the anti gun control group. Additionally, people that live in urban areas might have different opinions than people living the suburbs.
```

## Anything you find from the map or data that is different from your expectation before the exercise, or anything that stands out to you

```
    I found that the word cloud does not really accurately depict the sentiment of guns from the dataset. The word clouds does not show a definite stance on the topic between the three cities whereas the csv data could sort of make out a stance. The contexts of the tweets were also not what I expected, in the los angeles csv there were a lot of tweets that were not related to gun violence but things like video games.
